### Building Process

- I started by creating the Html structure;
- once I had all the elements ready, I set up and organized the sections and divs with CSS;
- then I created the paperStock array with all the products on the "Paper Stock Option" table;
- after all the elements were in place, I started the logic with javascript;
- I started from the calculator, creating all the options in the drop down menu, and creating the filter function for the checkbox;
- next step was creating the validations;
- then I created the math functions, and the elements shown on the results table;
- I organized all the variables at the top of the file;
- The last javascript step was the "Adjust Response" function, which allows the customer to go back to the previous "page" and adjust the data inserted;
- Tested and retested to fixed some bugs;
- After everything was working well, I went back to styling it and I gave it my personal touch to it. :)
- Considering that I had some extra time, I tried to implement it with typescript.
